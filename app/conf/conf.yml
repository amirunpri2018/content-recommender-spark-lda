# A TARGET is a website or web resource whose contents should be analyzed
# by the system for finding recommendations that are similar to your interests
# based on analysis of your browsing history.
# Every target has a 
#   - name: a friendly name for the target.
#   - type: a type that decides which target handler plugin handles the target.
#           This should match the 'self.type' attribute of one of the target handlers.
#   - <other handler specific attributes documented in respective handler's source code>

  # query: (Optional) Makes youtube API search only matching videos. Kind of pointless
  #         when the whole point of topic modelling is to find content with
  #         hidden relationships, but use it if you know what you're doing.
